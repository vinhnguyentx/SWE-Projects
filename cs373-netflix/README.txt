Write a program, ideally with a partner, to win the Netflix Prize in Python.

It must produce an RMSE (truncated to two decimal places) of less than 1.00 and a runtime of less than 1 min on probe.txt and on the acceptance tests.

Note: Because the Netflix files are very large, it may be impractical to make copies of them to your local machine. If so, you can develop the solution on the CS machines.

You may not use any libraries except for Python Pickle.
